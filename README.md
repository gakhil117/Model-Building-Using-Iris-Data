# Model-Building-Using-Iris-Data

Iris Data is contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.

I have used supervised models such as:

A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. 
It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.

Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems.
It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.

SVM - The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an 
N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.
To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. 
Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes.
Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.
